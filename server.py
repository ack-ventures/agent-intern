"""Antigravity CLI (agy) bridge — fastmcp server.

Exposes Antigravity CLI as MCP tools so Claude Code (or any MCP host) can
use it as a sub-agent. Historically agy had a headless print-mode "stdout bug"
(verified broken through 1.0.14): `agy -p` wrote its progress/answer to the
controlling terminal (TTY/console) directly, NOT to its stdout file descriptor
— so a captured-stdout read got nothing, and the bridge read the real response
from agy's own transcript files instead. agy 1.0.15 FIXED this on Windows: `-p`
now writes the clean final answer straight to stdout in a non-TTY subprocess
(verified empirically — stdout carries only the answer, no tool-calling
narration). So _run_agy now PREFERS stdout when present and falls back to
transcript-scraping only when stdout is empty (older agy, non-Windows per the
1.0.15 changelog, or a --sandbox run). As of agy 1.1.8 that stdout is a structured
JSON result object rather than bare text — see the structured-output note below.
The bridge still detaches agy from the
host's controlling terminal when spawning it (see _spawn_kwargs), which prevents
the pre-1.0.15 terminal leak into the host TUI and is harmless on 1.0.15+.
State-file layout and transcript schema re-verified on agy 1.0.15.

WHAT THIS SERVER EXPOSES (see the tool-visibility block below). Tools are grouped
by backend and only the ENABLED groups are registered with FastMCP — a hidden
group's tools don't appear in the client's tool list at all. The default is
codex, copilot, cursor, claude; antigravity and swarm are OFF because both drive
`agy -p`, which runs with --dangerously-skip-permissions and no usable sandbox
(see the SECURITY note below). Override with AGENT_INTERN_TOOLS=all, or a list
like AGENT_INTERN_TOOLS=codex,claude.

The live "watch" viewer (a localhost HTTP server plus a browser window streaming
a sub-agent's steps) is OFF unless AGENT_INTERN_WATCH is truthy. With it off the
`watch` argument is absent from every advertised tool schema, ignored if passed
anyway, and no HTTP listener is ever bound. This server makes NO network calls of
its own — there is no update check, no telemetry; the only egress is whatever the
backend CLIs do with your prompts.

Auth: piggybacks on whatever credential store `agy` itself uses on the host
OS (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, libsecret on Linux). User
must have logged in interactively at least once via the Antigravity IDE or
`agy -i`. Uses the same AI Pro quota. The bridge itself only does cross-
platform filesystem reads under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/`.

Model: defaults to agy's settings.json "model" field (e.g. gemini-3.6-flash-high).
agy 1.0.5 added a --model flag (and a `models` subcommand); through
~1.0.14 switching to a DIFFERENT model in -p HUNG the call (verified on 1.0.5:
the active label returned in seconds, any other hung >60s), so the bridge kept
its distance. Re-verified on 1.0.16 that the hang is FIXED: `agy -p --model
"<label>"` switches the model and returns in seconds (a Claude label answered as
Anthropic Claude, a Gemini label as Gemini). So antigravity_ask/continue and the
antigravity swarm path now take an optional `model`. Unknown labels: through
1.1.1 agy SILENTLY IGNORED an unknown --model, falling back to the settings.json
default with NO error; 1.1.2 changed -p to hard-fail with a non-zero exit that
lists the valid labels (interactive sessions keep the fallback-with-warning).
The bridge still validates a requested label against `agy models` (via
validate_model) and raises on a typo — that now fails fast WITHOUT spending an
agy call, and keeps the guard meaningful on pre-1.1.2 agy where a typo would
otherwise run the wrong model silently. When the label list can't be read (agy
missing, models call failed) validation is skipped and the label passes through
unchecked. `agy models` itself must be
run with stdin closed (it blocks on an interactive terminal otherwise), same as
-p is spawned with DEVNULL stdin.

Model SLUGS (agy 1.1.5, list re-checked live on 1.1.8) — the label format CHANGED
and every old example is now invalid. 1.1.5 introduced "stable, user-facing model
slugs" that the /model picker shows and --model accepts, and `agy models` now emits
ONLY those slugs. The live list (re-read on 1.1.8, unchanged since 1.1.6) is:
gemini-3.6-flash-{low,medium,high},
gemini-3.5-flash-{low,medium,high}, gemini-3.1-pro-{low,high}, claude-sonnet-4-6,
claude-opus-4-6-thinking, gpt-oss-120b-medium — 1.1.6 ADDED the gemini-3.6-flash
family and moved the settings.json default to Gemini 3.6 Flash (High) (verified
live; both the default path and `--model gemini-3.6-flash-high` round-tripped
clean, and the JSONL + SQLite read paths still match its unchanged schema). The old
human labels ("Gemini 3.5 Flash (High)", "Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Thinking)") are GONE
from the list, so
validate_model rejects them — verified live on 1.1.5: the old label raised
"unknown agy model ... expected one of: <slugs>" without spending a call, while
`--model gemini-3.5-flash-high` round-tripped clean. Nothing in the bridge's
machinery had to change (validation was always format-agnostic, which is exactly
why the whole suite stayed green through this break) — but every docstring and
README example that named an old label was actively steering callers into a
failed first call, so all of them now name slugs. Note the slug bakes the
reasoning effort in for the models that expose variants, which is why there are
three flash entries and no separate effort argument here; 1.1.5 also added an
`--effort low|medium|high` session flag as a second axis, which this bridge does
NOT pass — the slug already pins the combination we want.

Compat (re-verified on agy 1.0.15): state-file paths, last_conversations.json
(still keyed by workspace path), and the transcript schema are unchanged, and a
normally-completing -p run still writes the JSONL transcript this bridge reads —
re-confirmed with a live round-trip. NEW in 1.0.15: `agy -p` also writes the
clean answer to stdout on Windows (the print-mode non-TTY-output fix), so the
bridge now prefers stdout and uses the transcript only as a fallback; the
transcript path stays fully exercised on older agy, non-Windows, and --sandbox
runs. (The other 1.0.15 changes don't touch this bridge: the "MCP connection
timeout → 60 s" is agy acting as an MCP *client* connecting to custom servers —
the opposite direction from this bridge — and the rest are interactive-TUI /
paste-shortcut / permissions-panel fixes.) (Nothing in agy 1.0.13 or 1.0.14 touches
this bridge either: their changes are interactive-TUI / plugin / skill /
browser-task fixes plus permission-rule tweaks — strict-by-default "Always
Approve" matching, a regex: opt-in, relaxed redirection checks — and
permissions still do NOT gate -p. 1.0.14's "MCP configuration path mismatch"
fix concerns agy loading custom MCP servers as a CLIENT, the opposite direction
from this bridge, which drives agy via its CLI. 1.0.13's removed "Resume in the
same project" exit-hint line doesn't matter: the bridge reads the transcript,
never agy's stdout, which it surfaces only on a non-zero exit.) (Nothing in agy
1.0.12 — interactive
--project/--new-project launch flags and the "default project regardless of active
workspace" resolution change, Esc-confirm in comment mode, OSC8 terminal hyperlinks,
reverse diff cycling (shift+n), ctrl+o scrollback fix, Makefile/LaTeX code-block
rendering, the AES-NI/DPI-firewall TLS fix, or the backtab/pgdown key-string
fixes — touches the paths, schema, or the print-mode TTY-leak this bridge depends
on. The new permission-config precedence — per-project files under
~/.gemini/config/projects/ now outrank ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json —
is config the bridge never reads; the "model" field still lives in settings.json,
and permissions still do NOT gate -p, so the SECURITY note below stands. The bridge
also never passes --project, relying on cwd=workspace + conversation pinning.) agy
now ALSO dual-writes every
conversation to a SQLite store at ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/conversations/<id>.db;
the 1.0.4
changelog says SQLite "will be the CLI's conversation format", so JSONL is on its
way out. _read_response handles this: it reads the JSONL transcript when present
and falls back to the SQLite store (_read_response_db) when it isn't — already the
case for --sandbox runs — so the bridge keeps working once JSONL goes away. The
1.0.5 -p metadata fix also stopped agy from writing metadata to the cwd, so
last_conversations.json now updates reliably under cache/.

Execution modes (agy 1.1.0): 1.1.0 added an agent execution-mode system — a
`--mode` launch flag (accept-edits | plan) plus a new interactive default,
request-review, that PAUSES before file writes to show a diff preview. This does
NOT affect the bridge. `-p` is spawned with DEVNULL stdin, and the request-review
approval gate only engages on an INTERACTIVE stdin: given EOF-on-stdin, print mode
still auto-executes every tool call with no prompt (re-verified on 1.1.0 — a
file-writing task completed and wrote its file in ~36 s, exit 0, identically with
and without `--mode accept-edits`). So the bridge keeps NOT passing `--mode`; the
`request-review` toolPermission agy has logged since 1.0.5 stays a no-op for -p.
Full compat re-verified on 1.1.0 via the bridge itself: ask + conversation-pinned
continue round-trips return clean over stdout, and base dir /
last_conversations.json / JSONL-primary transcript are all intact (SQLite
dual-write present — 260 .db — but JSONL still written).

Headless permissions (agy 1.1.3) — the one change that DID break this bridge, and
why we now pass --dangerously-skip-permissions. Everything above about print mode
auto-executing tools was true through 1.1.2. 1.1.3 closed exactly that gap: a tool
needing a permission confirmation is no longer auto-approved headlessly, it is
SOFT-DENIED (print mode has no way to prompt), and agy names the allow-rule on
stderr. Verified on 1.1.3: without the flag even a plain "read pyproject.toml and
report the version" is denied — agy exits 0 having done nothing, stdout empty,
stderr "a tool required the \"command\" permission ... so it was auto-denied". That
makes every tool-using bridge call dead, so _agy_base_args now passes
--dangerously-skip-permissions on all six agy argv paths (ask/continue, watch,
image, and the four swarm workers). Verified with the flag: file writes, terminal
commands and workspace reads all run again, exit 0 with the clean answer on stdout
(a bridge round-trip against this repo returned the correct pyproject version).
ORDER MATTERS — see _agy_base_args: `-p` takes the prompt as its VALUE, so the flag
must precede it or it BECOMES the prompt. Note the 1.1.3 gate is NOT a usable
safety knob for this bridge, for the same reason as --sandbox: it denies read-only
file reads and cannot prompt, so "gated" here means a sub-agent that can do
nothing — hence no opt-out knob. That exit-0-with-no-answer shape is also why
_run_agy now folds agy's stderr into the error when the transcript scrape comes up
empty; otherwise agy's actionable notice never reaches the caller.

1.1.4 walked back part of that gate, and it does NOT affect us. Its note reads
"headless (-p) runs now honor persisted settings.json policies, including
permissions, file access, sandbox mode, auto-execution, and artifact review" —
i.e. -p stopped being a blanket soft-deny and instead follows whatever the user's
settings.json says. That would matter if we relied on the default, but
--dangerously-skip-permissions still wins over those persisted policies, so the
flag stays load-bearing and stays exactly where it is. Re-verified live on 1.1.4
against a workspace deliberately ABSENT from settings.json trustedWorkspaces and
with a permissions.allow list naming neither file nor command access: a workspace
file read returned the right contents, and a terminal command and a file write
both executed. Two consequences worth keeping in mind: the flag is now the only
thing standing between a bridge call and the user's own settings.json policy, and
a user who removed it hoping for a safety gate would get whatever their
settings.json happens to say rather than the 1.1.3 deny-everything — neither
changes this module's posture, which already assumes arbitrary code execution.

Rest of 1.1.1–1.1.4 reviewed: nothing else breaks the bridge, and several changes
help it. Benign-and-beneficial: 1.1.1 made `-p` return a non-zero exit + stderr on
a server-side failure (was a silent empty success) and stopped `-p` reading stdin
when the prompt comes from a flag (we already pass DEVNULL, so belt-and-suspenders
against the subprocess hang); 1.1.2 makes a truly headless run with no auth
fail-fast instead of blocking; 1.1.3 fixed conversations breaking after certain
tool calls (corrupted history that blocked all further responses) — a win for the
continue/transcript path; 1.1.4 stopped `/btw` side-questions leaking into the
conversation list as duplicates carrying the PARENT's title, which is the list
_read_last_conv_id picks from, so one way to resume the wrong conversation is now
gone (we never issue /btw ourselves, but the user's interactive sessions share
that store). Not-us: the 1.1.2/1.1.3 "MCP servers hanging / schema
paths / leaked subprocesses" fixes are agy acting as an MCP *client* toward custom
servers — the opposite direction from this bridge, which drives agy's CLI. The rest
(1.1.3 `/codesearch`, no-flickering copy-on-select, compaction markers, startup /
render / keybinding fixes; 1.1.1 artifact-viewer search, nested-subagent display,
`--project` default rename; 1.1.4 stacked leading slash commands, `/diff` scroll
jitter, a custom Enter binding, and clearer eligibility errors) is interactive-TUI
and never on the `-p` path. 1.1.4's `subagent: false` fix (agents declaring it were
still invocable as subagents) rides along on `--agent`, which this bridge does not
pass — it stays on agy's default agent. One
security-tightening note, not a break: 1.1.3 stopped auto-approving out-of-workspace
writes in always-proceed mode; the module's SECURITY posture stays deliberately
conservative regardless (assume arbitrary code), so no claim is loosened on it.

Structured print-mode output (agy 1.1.8) — the first agy change that lets this
bridge DELETE guesswork rather than work around a break, and the reason the
transcript/SQLite scraping described above is now a FALLBACK rather than the primary
read path. 1.1.8 gave `-p` an `--output-format` flag (text | json | stream-json)
plus `--json-schema`. Nothing
broke — re-verified live on 1.1.8 that the pre-existing text path still round-trips
(ask, conversation-pinned continue, and `--model` all returned clean) — but the
`json` format is strictly better than parsing bare text, so _run_agy now asks for
it whenever supports_json_output() says the installed agy is 1.1.8+. Verified live,
the result is one object: {conversation_id, status, response, duration_seconds,
num_turns, usage{...,cache_read_tokens}}, and it composes with every flag this
bridge passes (`--conversation` continue returned num_turns=2 with memory intact,
`--model` round-tripped, `--dangerously-skip-permissions` unaffected).

Two things that buys us. (1) `response` is a contractual field, replacing the
"we verified stdout carries only the answer" assumption the text path rests on.
(2) `conversation_id` is agy telling us EXACTLY which conversation the run used —
previously the bridge could only infer that from last_conversations.json (shared
state agy rewrites for every session, including the user's own interactive TUI work
in the same folder) or from brain-dir mtimes. _run_agy now records that id per
workspace and _build_agy_args prefers it when pinning a continue, falling back to
last_conversations.json and then `-c`. Consequence worth knowing: on 1.1.8+ an
antigravity_continue resumes THIS BRIDGE's last thread in that workspace, where
before it could land on a conversation the user had started interactively in the
same folder since. That is what the pinning was always trying to do; it can only
now be done exactly. The map is process-local, so a restarted server simply falls
back to the old resolution order.

WATCH mode now rides the same 1.1.8 API, via `stream-json` (see _StreamWatch).
Instead of polling the undocumented JSONL transcript on a timer and inferring which
brain dir belongs to this run, the watched runners consume agy's typed NDJSON event
stream — `init` / `step_update` / `result` — straight off stdout. The premise was
verified before writing any of it: the events arrive INCREMENTALLY (a 17 s run
spread 18 events over 12.4 s), and a live watched run through the bridge grew its
step count 0 → 3 → 6 → 7 while agy worked. What the stream gives that the scrape
could not: the real `tool_info.parameters.CommandLine` as a nested object (the
transcript stores tool args JSON-encoded inside a string, which is why
_clean_tool_arg exists), `text_delta` fragments per agent_response step, explicit
ACTIVE→DONE transitions, and `conversation_id` — so a WATCHED run now records its
conversation for later pinning exactly like the plain path, closing an asymmetry
that used to leave watch depending on last_conversations.json. The answer comes
from the terminal `result` event, which is the SAME field the plain path reads, so
watch=True and watch=False can no longer disagree about what the answer is.

Two things still read the transcript on purpose. Continue-mode history seeding
(_read_agy_history) shows PRIOR turns in the viewer, and stream-json describes only
the current run — it is cosmetic and already degrades to [] when unreadable. And
every stream path keeps _resolve_and_read as a fallback for a run that produces no
`result` event (agy died mid-stream, or ignored the flag). Pre-1.1.8 agy keeps the
whole original _WatchFeed path, re-verified live by forcing supports_json_output()
off against a real agy: no --output-format in argv, transcript scrape, right answer.

`--json-schema` remains unadopted: it works (verified — it adds a validated
`structured_output` object alongside the prose `response`) but no bridge tool
currently needs a caller-supplied schema.

ANSWER SHAPE — a deliberate, user-visible change. agy's `response` is the whole
turn: every agent_response step concatenated. The old transcript scrape returned
only the LAST completed PLANNER_RESPONSE. On a single-step ask they are identical
(verified: '0.21.4' both ways), but on a chatty multi-step run they differ — measured
on one run, 297 chars ("I will first count the .py files.\nNext, I will print today's
date.\n…\nCompleted counting .py files (19 found)…") versus 128 for the last step
alone, with the json answer ENDING IN the transcript answer. The full turn is what
the bridge now returns, on every path. Rationale: `result.response` is agy's own
contract for "what this turn produced", and this release's whole direction is to
trust that contract instead of the bridge's reconstruction of it — the last-step
rule was never a product decision, just the best a transcript scrape could do, and
it silently DROPS content whenever the model does its real work and then closes with
a short "Done." The cost is narration noise on multi-step runs; the watch window
exists to show that narration, but dropping content is not recoverable.

Why the version gate rather than "just pass the flag": on 1.1.8 an unrecognised
--output-format VALUE is silently ignored and agy prints plain text (verified —
`--output-format bogus` exited 0 with a normal answer), but a pre-1.1.8 agy has no
such FLAG at all and could fail arg parsing on every call. supports_json_output()
therefore checks the version and answers False when it can't be parsed, and
_parse_json_result returns None on anything that isn't the expected object so a
silently-ignored flag degrades to the text path instead of crashing.

Rest of 1.1.7 reviewed, nothing else touches this bridge: the `-p` fix for sending
a prompt before the account-eligibility check finished is a benign win on our exact
path; the disabled-plugins-still-running-hooks fix, the MCP OAuth relaxation
(Salesforce/Atlassian — agy as an MCP *client*, the opposite direction from this
bridge), the `/btw` first-action crash, and the Windows CJK clipboard-copy fix are
all interactive-TUI or client-side. Same for the rest of 1.1.8: `copyOnSelect` is a
TUI setting, and the compound-command allow-always improvement is an interactive
permission-prompt change (print mode still bypasses that via
--dangerously-skip-permissions).

SECURITY — read this: `agy -p` runs the model as an autonomous agent that
executes its tools (read/write files, run shell commands, reach the network)
with no approval gate. Through 1.1.2 that was unconditional and had NO opt-out:
re-verified empirically on agy 1.0.9 / Windows that print mode ran
out-of-workspace writes even WITHOUT --dangerously-skip-permissions, a no-op for
-p at the time, and agy 1.0.5's permission system (its logs show
toolPermission=request-review) never gated print-mode execution either. agy 1.1.3
added a real headless gate at last — but it soft-denies so broadly (plain file
reads included) that a gated -p can do no useful work, so this bridge opts out of
it with --dangerously-skip-permissions (see the headless-permissions note above).
The flag is load-bearing now rather than decorative, and what it restores is
exactly the posture this note has always described: assume every call runs
arbitrary code with your privileges.

--sandbox is NOT a usable safety knob for this bridge. agy 1.0.6 fixed
--sandbox flag propagation into -p (its 1.0.6 changelog calls this "sandbox
isolation correctly enforced"), and verified here it now DOES block terminal/
shell command execution in print mode. But that "isolation" is partial and
misleadingly named: re-verified on 1.0.9 that under --sandbox the model still
wrote a file OUTSIDE its workspace via the write_to_file tool — so --sandbox
does NOT constrain filesystem writes or network egress, only the terminal.
(agy 1.0.9 hardened the sandbox's command path — stricter exact-match command
checks, .git added to its dangerous-paths list — but none of that closes the
out-of-workspace write_to_file hole.) Worse for us, a --sandbox run that hits
a blocked terminal command writes NO JSONL transcript (only the SQLite .db, as
re-confirmed on 1.0.9), so the bridge would fail to read a response.
Re-verified on 1.1.0: nothing here changed. A sandboxed terminal command still
gets blocked and stalls print mode (it returned "Error: timeout waiting for
response", exit 1, having executed nothing), while write_to_file still runs under
--sandbox and still lands OUTSIDE the declared workspace (exit 0). The new 1.1.0
`--mode accept-edits` and `--sandbox` coexist without error, but neither makes -p
safe. For both reasons the bridge deliberately does NOT pass --sandbox. There is
still no agy flag that makes print mode both safe and useful: 1.1.3's headless
permission gate is the closest thing, and it lands on the useless side of that
line (see the headless-permissions note above).

So `workspace` is only a starting context, NOT a security boundary:
every call effectively runs arbitrary code with your privileges. Only invoke
this bridge with trusted prompts on trusted content (untrusted input here is
the classic prompt-injection "lethal trifecta"). For real isolation, run the
whole bridge inside a container or VM.

    context with you; a terse one-liner wastes the call.

    Runs in automode by default (sandbox="default"); pass sandbox="read-only" for
    a real boundary. `model` picks the backend: an Anthropic model (fable/opus/
    sonnet/haiku or claude-*) uses the plain `claude` CLI on this Anthropic
    account; any claude-os harness id (e.g. "ds-flash", "ds", "k3", or an id from

    provider's quota (DeepSeek/Kimi/etc.).
